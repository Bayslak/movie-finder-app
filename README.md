# Movie Finder App

My first React application! 🎬

## About This Project

This project was created by following the [JavaScript Mastery React Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCLhUialKPQ). It's a movie search application that helped me learn the fundamentals of React development.

## What It Does

This application allows users to:

- **Browse Popular Movies**: On initial load, the app displays a list of popular movies sorted by popularity
- **Search for Movies**: Users can search for specific movies using the search functionality
- **View Movie Details**: Each movie is displayed with its poster, title, and other relevant information
- **Real-time Updates**: The movie list updates automatically as you type in the search bar

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework with hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **The Movie Database (TMDb) API**: Provides movie data and posters
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling

## Key Features Implemented

- Component-based architecture (Search, MovieCard, Spinner components)
- API integration with TMDb
- State management using React hooks
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design
